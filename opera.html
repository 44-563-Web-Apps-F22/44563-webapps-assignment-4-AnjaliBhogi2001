        <h4>Act 2 <br>
         SCENE —Entrance Hall of the Grand Ducal Palace.</h4>
        <p>Enter BARONESS VON KRAKENFELDT, in a fury.

            BAR.  With fury indescribable I burn! With rage I'm nearly ready to explode!
                  There'll be grief and tribulation when I learn To whom this slight unbearable is owed!
                              For whatever may be due I'll pay it double—
                              There'll be terror indescribable and trouble! With a hurly-burly and a hubble-bubble
                        I'll pay you for this pretty episode!
          
            ALL.        Oh, whatever may be due she'll pay it double!—
                        It's very good of her to take the trouble—
                        But we don't know what she means by "hubble-bubble"—
                  No doubt it's an expression  la mode.
          
            BAR. (to LUDWIG).
                        Do you know who I am?
          
            LUD. (examining her).                     I don't;
                        Your countenance I can't fix, my dear.
          
            BAR.  This proves I'm not a sham.
                        (Showing pocket-handkerchief.)
          
            LUD. (examining it).                      It won't;
                  It only says "Krakenfeldt, Six," my dear.
          
            BAR.  Express your grief profound!
          
            LUD.                                      I shan't!
                        This tone I never allow, my love.
          
            BAR.  Rudolph at once produce!
          
            LUD.                                      I can't;
                        He isn't at home just now, my love.
          
            BAR. (astonished).      He isn't at home just now!
            ALL.        He isn't at home just now,
            (Dancing derisively.)         He has an appointment particular,
            very-
                        You'll find him, I think, in the town cemetery;
                        And that's how we come to be making so merry,
                              For he isn't at home just now!
          
            BAR.  But bless my heart and soul alive, it's impudence
                        personified!
                  I've come here to be matrimonially matrimonified!
          
            LUD.  For any disappointment I am sorry unaffectedly,
                  But yesterday that nobleman expired quite unexpectedly—
          
            ALL (sobbing).    Tol the riddle lol!
                              Tol the riddle lol!
