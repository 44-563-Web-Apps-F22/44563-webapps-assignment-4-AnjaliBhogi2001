        <p class="d">As before you we defile,<br>
                    Eloia!  Eloia!<br>

        Ludwig and his Julia true<br>

   <h4 class="song"> SONG—LUDWIG<br></h4>

  <p>At the outset I may mention it's my sovereign intention<br>
        To revive the classic memories of Athens at its best,<br>
  For the company possesses all the necessary dresses<br>
        And a course of quiet cramming will supply us with the<br>
  rest.<br>
  We've a choir hyporchematic (that is, ballet-operatic)<br>
       

  (Confidentially to audience.)<br>
        At this juncture I may mention<br>
              That this erudition sham<br>
        Is but classical pretension,<br>
              The result of steady "cram.":<br>
        Periphrastic methods spurning,<br>
        To this audience discerning<br>
        I admit this show of learning<br>
              Is the fruit of steady "cram."!<br>

  
      

           <h6 class="BAR">BAR.<br></h6>   <p>With fury indescribable I burn! With rage I'm nearly ready to explode!<br>
                  There'll be grief and tribulation when I learn To whom this slight unbearable is owed!<br>
                              For whatever may be due I'll pay it double—<br>
                              There'll be terror indescribable and trouble! With a hurly-burly and a hubble-bubble<br>
                        I'll pay you for this pretty episode!<br></p>
          
            <h6 class="ALL">ALL.</h6>       <p>Oh, whatever may be due she'll pay it double!—<br>
                        It's very good of her to take the trouble—<br>
                        But we don't know what she means by "hubble-bubble"—<br>
                  No doubt it's an expression  la mode.<br></p>
      
          
            <h6 class="LUD">LUD.</h6>   <p>(examining her).                     I don't;<br>

            <h6 class="BAR">BAR.</h6>  <p>This proves I'm not a sham.<br>
                        (Showing pocket-handkerchief.)<br></p>
          
            <h6 class="LUD">LUD.</h6>  <p>(examining it).                      It won't;<br>
                  It only says "Krakenfeldt, Six," my dear.<br></p>

            very-
                        You'll find him, I think, in the town cemetery;<br>
                        And that's how we come to be making so merry,<br>
                              For he isn't at home just now!<br></p>
          
            <h6 class="BAR">BAR.</h6>  <p>But bless my heart and soul alive, it's impudence<br>
