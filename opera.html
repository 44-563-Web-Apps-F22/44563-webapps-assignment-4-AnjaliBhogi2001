         SCENE —Entrance Hall of the Grand Ducal Palace.</h5>
        <pre>Enter BARONESS VON KRAKENFELDT, in a fury.<br>

            BAR.  With fury indescribable I burn! With rage I'm nearly ready to explode!<br>
                  There'll be grief and tribulation when I learn To whom this slight unbearable is owed!<br>
                              For whatever may be due I'll pay it double—<br>
                              There'll be terror indescribable and trouble! With a hurly-burly and a hubble-bubble<br>
                        I'll pay you for this pretty episode!<br>
          
            ALL.        Oh, whatever may be due she'll pay it double!—<br>
                        It's very good of her to take the trouble—<br>
                        But we don't know what she means by "hubble-bubble"—<br>
                  No doubt it's an expression  la mode.<br>
          
            BAR. (to LUDWIG).<br>
                        Do you know who I am?<br>

                        Your countenance I can't fix, my dear.<br>
          
            BAR.  This proves I'm not a sham.<br>
                        (Showing pocket-handkerchief.)<br>
          
            LUD. (examining it).                      It won't;<br>
                  It only says "Krakenfeldt, Six," my dear.<br>
          
            BAR.  Express your grief profound!<br>
          
            LUD.                                      I shan't!<br>
                        This tone I never allow, my love.<br>
          
            BAR.  Rudolph at once produce!<br>
          
            LUD.                                      I can't;<br>
                        He isn't at home just now, my love.<br>
          
            BAR. (astonished).      He isn't at home just now!<br>
            ALL.        He isn't at home just now,<br>

            very-
                        You'll find him, I think, in the town cemetery;<br>
                        And that's how we come to be making so merry,<br>
                              For he isn't at home just now!<br>
          
            BAR.  But bless my heart and soul alive, it's impudence<br>
                        personified!<br>
                  I've come here to be matrimonially matrimonified!<br>
          
            LUD.  For any disappointment I am sorry unaffectedly,<br>
