        <p>As before you we defile,<br>
                    Eloia!  Eloia!<br>
        Pray you, gentles, do not smile<br>
        If we shout, in classic style,<br>
                    Eloia!<br>
        Ludwig and his Julia true<br>
        Wedded are each other to—<br>
        So we sing, till all is blue,<br>
                    Eloia!  Eloia!<br>
                    Opoponax!  Eloia!<br>

        Wreaths of bay and ivy twine,<br>
                    Eloia!  Eloia!<br>
        Fill the bowl with Lesbian wine,<br>
        And to revelry incline—<br>
                    Eloia!<br>

        For as gaily we pass on<br>
        Probably we shall, anon,<br>
        Sing a Diergeticon—<br>
                    Eloia! Eloia!<br>
                    Opoponax! Eloia!<br></p>

  

                        <h4 class="song"> SONG—LUDWIG<br></h4>

  <p>At the outset I may mention it's my sovereign intention<br>
        To revive the classic memories of Athens at its best,<br>
  For the company possesses all the necessary dresses<br>
        And a course of quiet cramming will supply us with the<br>
  rest.<br>
  We've a choir hyporchematic (that is, ballet-operatic)<br>
        Who respond to the choreut of that cultivated age,<br>
  And our clever chorus-master, all but captious criticaster<br>
        Would accept as the choregus of the early Attic stage.<br>
  This return to classic ages is considered in their wages,<br>
        Which are always calculated by the day or by the week—<br>
  And I'll pay 'em (if they'll back me) all in oboloi and drachm,<br>
        Which they'll get (if they prefer it) at the Kalends that<br>
              are Greek<br>

  (Confidentially to audience.)<br>
        At this juncture I may mention<br>
              That this erudition sham<br>
        Is but classical pretension,<br>
              The result of steady "cram.":<br>
        Periphrastic methods spurning,<br>
        To this audience discerning<br>
        I admit this show of learning<br>
              Is the fruit of steady "cram."!<br>

  

  (Confidentially to audience.)<br>
              And perhaps I'd better mention,<br>
                    Lest alarming you I am,<br>
              That it isn't our intention<br>
                    To perform a Dithyramb—<br>
              It displays a lot of stocking,<br>
              Which is always very shocking,<br>
              And of course I'm only mocking<br>
                    At the prevalence of "cram"!<br></p>
      

           <h6 class="BAR">BAR.<br></h6>   <p>With fury indescribable I burn! With rage I'm nearly ready to explode!<br>
                  There'll be grief and tribulation when I learn To whom this slight unbearable is owed!<br>
                              For whatever may be due I'll pay it double—<br>
                              There'll be terror indescribable and trouble! With a hurly-burly and a hubble-bubble<br>
                        I'll pay you for this pretty episode!<br></p>
          
            <h6 class="ALL">ALL.</h6>       <p>Oh, whatever may be due she'll pay it double!—<br>
                        It's very good of her to take the trouble—<br>
                        But we don't know what she means by "hubble-bubble"—<br>
                  No doubt it's an expression  la mode.<br></p>
          
            <h6 clss="BAR">BAR.</h6>  <p>(to LUDWIG).<br>
                        Do you know who I am?<br></p>
          
            <h6 class="LUD">LUD.</h6>   <p>(examining her).                     I don't;<br>
                        Your countenance I can't fix, my dear.<br></p>
          
            <h6 class="BAR">BAR.</h6>  <p>This proves I'm not a sham.<br>
                        (Showing pocket-handkerchief.)<br></p>
          
            <h6 class="LUD">LUD.</h6>  <p>(examining it).                      It won't;<br>
                  It only says "Krakenfeldt, Six," my dear.<br></p>
          
            <h6 class="BAR">BAR.</h6>  <p>Express your grief profound!<br></p>
          
            <h6 class="LUD">LUD.</h6>                                     <p> I shan't!<br>
                        This tone I never allow, my love.<br></p>
          
            <h6 class="BAR">BAR.</h6>  <p>Rudolph at once produce!<br></p>
          
            <h6 class="LUD">LUD.</h6>                                     <p> I can't;<br>
                        He isn't at home just now, my love.<br></p>
          
            <h6 class="BAR">BAR.</h6>   <p>(astonished).      He isn't at home just now!<br></p>
            <h6 class="ALL">ALL.</h6>       <p> He isn't at home just now,<br>
            (Dancing derisively.)         He has an appointment particular,<br>
            very-
                        You'll find him, I think, in the town cemetery;<br>
                        And that's how we come to be making so merry,<br>
                              For he isn't at home just now!<br></p>
          
            <h6 class="BAR">BAR.</h6>  <p>But bless my heart and soul alive, it's impudence<br>
                        personified!<br>
                  I've come here to be matrimonially matrimonified!<br></p>
          
            <h6 class="LUD">LUD.</h6>   <p>For any disappointment I am sorry unaffectedly,<br>
                  But yesterday that nobleman expired quite unexpectedly—<br></p>
          
            <h6 class="ALL">ALL.</h6>  <p>(sobbing).    Tol the riddle lol!<br>
                              Tol the riddle lol!<br>
                  Tol the riddle, lol the riddle, lol lol lay!<br>
