           <h6>BAR.<br></h6>   <p>With fury indescribable I burn! With rage I'm nearly ready to explode!<br>
                  There'll be grief and tribulation when I learn To whom this slight unbearable is owed!<br>
                              For whatever may be due I'll pay it double—<br>
                              There'll be terror indescribable and trouble! With a hurly-burly and a hubble-bubble<br>
